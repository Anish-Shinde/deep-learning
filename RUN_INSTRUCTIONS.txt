CSV Data Analyzer — Simple Run Instructions
=============================================

What is this?
-------------
A web-based tool to analyze, clean, and build machine learning models with your CSV data files. No coding required - just upload your data and click buttons!

Quick Start (5 Simple Steps)
-----------------------------

Step 1: Check Python Installation
Open PowerShell and type:
```powershell
python --version
```
✅ You should see something like "Python 3.8.x" or higher. If not, install Python from python.org first.

Step 2: Open Project Folder
Navigate to the project folder in PowerShell:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Aarav Comp\Desktop\submission\deep learning"
```

Step 3: Create Virtual Environment
This keeps the project dependencies separate:
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

⚠️ **Important**: If you see an error about a path mismatch (like "CSV Aalyzer" when you're in "deep learning"), delete the old `.venv` folder first:
```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .venv
python -m venv .venv
```

Step 4: Activate Virtual Environment
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
💡 If you see an error about execution policy, run this first (then try again):
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

✅ **Check**: After activation, you should see `(.venv)` at the start of your command line. This means it's activated correctly!

Step 5: Install Dependencies & Run
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run csv_analyzer.py
```

**Alternative Method (More Reliable):**
If the above doesn't work, you can run Streamlit directly using the virtual environment's Python:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run csv_analyzer.py
```
This method doesn't require activating the virtual environment first.

🎉 That's it! Your browser should open automatically. If not, look for a URL like http://localhost:8501

⚠️ **Important Notes**:
- Make sure you're in the correct folder (the one containing `csv_analyzer.py`)
- The virtual environment (`.venv`) must be in the same folder as your project
- Always activate the virtual environment before running the app (you'll see `(.venv)` in your command line)

Using the Application
---------------------
1. **Upload Your CSV**: Click "Upload your CSV file" and select your data file
2. **Explore Data**: Use the "📊 Data Explorer" tab to see your data overview
3. **Clean Data**: Use the "🔧 Data Transformation" tab to fix missing values, filter rows, etc.
4. **Analyze**: Use the "📈 Analytics & Modeling" tab to create visualizations and train models
5. **Learn DL**: Use the "🧠 Deep Learning Concepts" tab to see how neural networks work

Sample Data Files
-----------------
Try these included sample files to test the app:
- `patients.csv` - Medical patient data
- `earthquake_data_tsunami.csv` - Earthquake and tsunami data

Common Issues & Solutions
-------------------------

❌ **"python is not recognized"**
   → Install Python from python.org and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

❌ **"streamlit is not recognized"**
   → Try using the direct Python method instead:
   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run csv_analyzer.py
   ```
   Or make sure you activated the virtual environment (Step 4). You should see `(.venv)` at the start of your command line.

❌ **"Activation script cannot be loaded"**
   → Run this command first:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
   Then try activating again.

❌ **"Fatal error in launcher" or "Unable to create process"**
   → This means your virtual environment was created in a different folder. Fix it:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .venv
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Then run using the direct Python method:
   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run csv_analyzer.py
   ```

❌ **"App runs but shows errors"**
   → Make sure you installed all dependencies with: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

❌ **App is slow**
   → Large datasets or complex models take time. Be patient, or try with a smaller sample of your data first.

💡 **Tips**: 
- Keep the PowerShell window open while using the app. Closing it will stop the application.
- If you're having trouble with activation, use the direct Python method: `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run csv_analyzer.py`
- To check if the app is running, look for Python processes or open http://localhost:8501 in your browser

What You Need
-------------
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection (for first-time package installation)
- A CSV file to analyze (or use the sample files included)

Optional: Deep Learning Features
---------------------------------
The app works great without TensorFlow! But if you want to try advanced deep learning features, install TensorFlow:
```powershell
pip install tensorflow
```
Note: This is optional and not required for basic data analysis and machine learning.

Quick Run Commands (Copy & Paste)
----------------------------------
If you've already set up the virtual environment before, you can quickly run the app with:

**Method 1 (With Activation):**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Aarav Comp\Desktop\submission\deep learning"
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
streamlit run csv_analyzer.py
```

**Method 2 (Direct Python - Recommended):**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Aarav Comp\Desktop\submission\deep learning"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run csv_analyzer.py
```

Need Help?
----------
- Check that all steps were completed successfully
- Make sure your CSV file is properly formatted (comma-separated values)
- Try the sample files first to verify everything works
- Use Method 2 (direct Python) if activation gives you trouble
- Restart from Step 4 if you encounter errors

Deploying to Streamlit Cloud
-----------------------------
If you're using Streamlit Cloud (streamlit.io) connected to your GitHub repository:

**When Updates Appear:**
- After pushing code to GitHub, Streamlit Cloud automatically detects changes
- Redeployment usually takes **1-3 minutes** after your push completes
- You'll see a "Redeploying..." status in your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- The app will automatically update once deployment finishes

**How to Check Deployment Status:**
1. Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard (share.streamlit.io)
2. Look for your app - it will show "Redeploying..." or "Deployed"
3. Click on your app to see deployment logs and status
4. Green checkmark = successfully deployed
5. Red X = deployment failed (check logs for errors)

**Manual Redeploy:**
- In Streamlit Cloud dashboard, click "⋮" (three dots) next to your app
- Select "Redeploy" to manually trigger a new deployment

**Troubleshooting Deployment:**
- If changes don't appear after 5 minutes, check:
  - Did you push to the correct branch? (usually `main` or `master`)
  - Are there any errors in the deployment logs?
  - Is your `requirements.txt` up to date with all dependencies?
  - Check that `csv_analyzer.py` is in the root directory

**Note:** The first deployment may take longer (5-10 minutes) as it installs all dependencies.
