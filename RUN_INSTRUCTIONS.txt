Advanced CSV Data Analyzer — Run Instructions

Summary:
This project is a single-file Streamlit application (`csv_analyzer.py`) that provides an interactive web UI for exploring, cleaning, visualizing, and running small deep-learning demos on CSV tabular data. It includes EDA tools, cleaning utilities, PCA/visualizations, and optional DL demos (MLP, LSTM, CNN examples). The utilities are split into the `utils/` package.

Quick PowerShell steps to run locally (Windows):

1) Verify Python is installed (recommended Python 3.8+):

```powershell
python --version
```

2) From the project root (the folder containing `csv_analyzer.py`), create and activate a virtual environment:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Aarav Comp\Desktop\CSV Aalyzer"
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If activation fails due to execution policy, run (may require elevated rights):

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Alternative activation using cmd:

```powershell
cmd /c ".venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat"
```

3) Install base dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```powershell
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```

4) Optional: install TensorFlow for deep-learning demos (DL features require TensorFlow for full functionality):

```powershell
pip install tensorflow
# or for a CPU-only wheel if needed:
# pip install tensorflow-cpu
```

5) Run the Streamlit app:

```powershell
streamlit run "c:\Users\Aarav Comp\Desktop\CSV Aalyzer\csv_analyzer.py"
```

Or, from the project directory:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Aarav Comp\Desktop\CSV Aalyzer"
streamlit run csv_analyzer.py
```

What to expect:
- Streamlit will open a local URL (usually http://localhost:8501). Open it in a browser.
- Use the file uploader to load your CSV, or try the included sample files (`patients.csv`, `earthquake_data_tsunami.csv`).
- The UI tabs: Overview, Clean Data, Analysis, DL Concepts. Deep-learning demos will only work if TensorFlow is installed.

Troubleshooting tips:
- Wrap paths with spaces in quotes when running `streamlit run`.
- If `streamlit` is not found, ensure the virtual environment is activated or that you installed dependencies into the correct Python environment.
- Activation blocked by PowerShell execution policy: either adjust the policy for the current user (RemoteSigned) or use the cmd activation script.
- Large datasets or DL training can be slow on CPU-only systems; reduce epochs or sample the data for testing.

Files of interest:
- `csv_analyzer.py` — main Streamlit app (entrypoint)
- `requirements.txt` — base dependencies (streamlit, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn)
- `utils/` — helper modules for UI, EDA, cleaning, and DL demos
- `patients.csv`, `earthquake_data_tsunami.csv` — sample CSVs included in the workspace

Optional follow-ups you can ask me to implement:
- Add a `run.ps1` script that automates venv creation, activation, install, and runs the app
- Create `requirements-dl.txt` with pinned TensorFlow and DL extras
- Add a small example CSV for the LSTM sequence demo
