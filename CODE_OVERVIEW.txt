Project root
------------
- csv_analyzer.py
  - Entry point: a Streamlit app that composes the UI from modules in `utils/`.
  - Mounts tabs: Data Explorer, Data Transformation, Analytics & Modeling, Deep Learning Concepts.
  - Handles file upload, session state (`st.session_state.original_df`, `st.session_state.df`), and wiring of each tab function.
  - Note: DL demos may require `tensorflow` installed to work fully (the app attempts to import TF in some code paths).

- requirements.txt
  - Lists base dependencies to run the app: streamlit, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-learn.
  - TensorFlow is intentionally NOT in this file; install it separately if you want the DL demos.

- RUN_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
  - Quick run guide (PowerShell) and troubleshooting tips. Created to make launching the app easier on Windows.

- patients.csv, earthquake_data_tsunami.csv (sample data files)
  - Example CSV datasets included in the workspace. Use these with the file uploader in the app to test functionality.

utils/ package
---------------
- utils/ui_utils.py
  - UI setup helpers: `setup_page()` configures Streamlit page and injects CSS styles.
  - `safe_rerun()` safely reruns the Streamlit app using `st.rerun()` (with fallback to `st.experimental_rerun()` for older versions), wrapped in try/except to avoid crashes.
  - Purpose: centralize cosmetic styles and a safe rerun helper used by cleaning operations.

- utils/overview_tab.py
  - `show_overview_tab(df)` displays dataset head, basic metadata (rows, columns, dtypes), descriptive statistics, and missing values summary.
  - Provides a download button to export the current dataset state as `cleaned_data.csv`.

- utils/cleaning_tab.py
  - `show_cleaning_tab(df, st_state)` provides interactive cleaning tools:
    - Drop columns
    - Fill missing values (mean, median, mode, or custom)
    - Convert data types (int/float/str/category)
    - Filter rows (numeric range slider or categorical selection)
    - Reset to original data
  - Uses `safe_rerun()` to refresh UI after changes and writes back to `st_state.df`.

- utils/eda.py
  - `show_eda_components(df)` aggregates exploratory data analysis components:
    - Value counts for a chosen column
    - Correlation matrix with heatmap (pearson/kendall/spearman)
    - Column-level statistics and visualizations (histograms, box plots, violin plots for numeric; bar/pie for categorical)
  - Built with matplotlib/seaborn and Streamlit plotting helpers.

- utils/mlp.py
  - `mlp_section(df, all_cols)` exposes a Multi-Layer Perceptron trainer via scikit-learn's `MLPClassifier` / `MLPRegressor`.
  - Auto-detects classification vs regression (heuristic) or accepts explicit user choice.
  - Parameters: feature selection, hidden layer sizes, activation, solver, learning rate, max iterations, early stopping, test split, standardization.
  - Trains model, shows metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, MSE/RMSE for regression), training loss curve (if available), and allows model download (pickle).
  - DL note: scikit-learn MLP is used here (not a TensorFlow/Keras model). For heavier DL experiments (CNNs/LSTMs) see the README notes — they may require TensorFlow and are not fully implemented in separate TF modules.

- utils/dl_concepts.py
  - `show_dl_concepts()` provides interactive, lightweight visualizations to teach DL concepts without requiring heavy frameworks:
    - Optimization demo: visualize 2D loss surface and simulate optimizers (Gradient Descent, Momentum, RMSProp, Adam).
    - Backpropagation demo: visualize a small neural net forward pass and activations with selectable activation functions.
    - Decision surfaces demo: visualize decision boundaries using Linear SVM (for educational visualization only) and a simple NN; plots loss functions (hinge, 0-1, log loss).
  - Purpose: pedagogical visualizations and conceptual demos implemented with NumPy and matplotlib + scikit-learn (LinearSVC used only for visualization demos). No TensorFlow dependency required for these visualizations.

- utils/model_utils.py
  - Helpers for serializing models and weights:
    - `model_pickle_bytes(model)` — pickle a scikit-learn model into bytes for Streamlit downloads (uses `joblib`).
    - `model_weights_bytes(model)` — attempts to save Keras-style model weights to a temporary .h5 file and return bytes (used when TensorFlow/Keras models are present).
  - Note: `model_weights_bytes` will only work for TF/Keras models; calling it without `tensorflow`-compatible model objects will raise or fail.

Notes about Deep Learning features
---------------------------------
- What is present in code:
  - Pedagogical DL visualizations in `utils/dl_concepts.py` (optimizers, backprop, decision surfaces) implemented with NumPy/matplotlib.
  - Scikit-learn MLP via `utils/mlp.py` for quick tabular MLP experiments (classification/regression) — not a TensorFlow model.
  - `utils/model_utils.py` contains helpers aimed at supporting both scikit-learn and Keras/TensorFlow models (the latter via `model.save_weights()` in a temporary file), but the project does not include full TF model training scripts in separate modules (no dedicated `lstm.py`, `cnn.py`, or `vae.py` in `utils/` as of this snapshot).

- What README mentions (and implications):
  - The README advertises additional DL demos (LSTM sequence demo, CNN demos for MNIST/CIFAR, MobileNetV2 transfer learning, and a dense VAE). These are described as "Deep Learning demos (optional, require TensorFlow)" but they are not present as separate TF modules in `utils/` in this code snapshot. If you need these demos, they must either be implemented in new modules or added into `csv_analyzer.py`/`utils/` with proper TensorFlow imports and gating.
  - Recommendation: install `tensorflow` only if you plan to implement or use TF-based demos. Many code paths attempt to detect TF, but some parts may assume `tf` exists and will error without it.

Next actions you might want me to do
-----------------------------------
- Add small TF examples (LSTM/CNN/VAE) into `utils/` and a `requirements-dl.txt` that pins a compatible `tensorflow` version.
- Implement safer TF gating: detect `tensorflow` import at startup and disable/hide TF-specific UI when not available.
- Add a `run.ps1` script to automate venv creation, dependency install, and app start.
- Create small, curated example CSVs for sequence and image tasks (if adding LSTM/CNN demos).

Error Handling & Validation
---------------------------
The application includes comprehensive error handling throughout:

- Data validation: Checks for empty datasets, missing values, and invalid operations
- Model training validation: Validates feature selection, target variables, and model parameters
- User input validation: Prevents common mistakes like using target as feature, invalid data types, etc.
- Graceful error messages: Clear, actionable error messages with hints to help users fix issues
- Safe operations: All data transformations and model training wrapped in try/except blocks
