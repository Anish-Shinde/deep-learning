HOW TO USE THE DIAGRAMS AND REPORT PROMPT
==========================================

1. REPORT GENERATION WITH CHATGPT:
   ---------------------------------
   Step 1: Open ChatGPT (or similar AI tool)
   Step 2: Copy the entire contents of REPORT_GENERATION_PROMPT.txt
   Step 3: Also copy the contents of CODE_OVERVIEW.txt
   Step 4: Paste both into ChatGPT with this instruction:
           "I have attached my CODE_OVERVIEW.txt file. Please generate a complete 
            project report following the structure and instructions in the prompt 
            I just provided."
   Step 5: ChatGPT will generate all sections of your report
   Step 6: Review and edit as needed

2. GENERATING PLANTUML DIAGRAMS:
   ------------------------------
   Option A: Online Editor (Easiest)
   - Go to http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/
   - Copy one @startuml ... @enduml block from diagrams.puml
   - Paste into the editor
   - Click "Submit" to render
   - Right-click image and "Save As" (PNG/SVG recommended)

   Option B: VS Code Extension
   - Install "PlantUML" extension in VS Code
   - Open diagrams.puml file
   - Press Alt+D (or right-click and "Preview PlantUML")
   - Export diagram as PNG/SVG

   Option C: Command Line
   - Install PlantUML: http://plantuml.com/starting
   - Run: java -jar plantuml.jar diagrams.puml
   - This generates PNG files for each diagram

3. WHICH DIAGRAMS TO INCLUDE IN YOUR REPORT:
   -------------------------------------------
   For Chapter 5 (UML DIAGRAM):
   - System Architecture Diagram (required)
   - Use Case Diagram (required)
   - Component Diagram (required)
   - At least one Activity Diagram (recommended: Main Workflow)
   - Sequence Diagram (recommended)

   For Chapter 6 (WORKING):
   - Activity Diagram - Data Cleaning Process
   - Activity Diagram - ML Model Training
   - Sequence Diagram - Data Processing Flow

4. DIAGRAM DESCRIPTIONS FOR YOUR REPORT:
   --------------------------------------
   When including diagrams in Chapter 5, add descriptions like:

   Figure 5.1: System Architecture Diagram
   "This diagram shows the layered architecture of the CSV Analyzer system,
   illustrating the separation between Presentation, Business Logic, Data Processing,
   and Machine Learning layers, along with their dependencies on external libraries."

   Figure 5.2: Use Case Diagram
   "This diagram represents all possible interactions between different user types
   (User, Data Analyst, Student) and the system functionalities, showing which
   features are accessible to each user type."

   Continue this pattern for all diagrams.

5. TIPS:
   - Generate diagrams one at a time to ensure quality
   - Use consistent colors/styles (PlantUML has themes)
   - Adjust diagram sizes in PlantUML if needed
   - Add captions and figure numbers when inserting into report
   - Ensure diagrams match the descriptions in your report text

6. PLANTUML THEMES (Optional):
   ----------------------------
   Add this line at the start of any diagram for different styles:
   !theme plain
   !theme aws-orange
   !theme bootstrap
   !theme cerulean
   !theme cyborg

   Example:
   @startuml System_Architecture
   !theme plain
   ... rest of diagram ...
